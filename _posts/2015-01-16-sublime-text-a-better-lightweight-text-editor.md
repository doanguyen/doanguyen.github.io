Heretofore I used to use notepad++ (N++) like an editor. It's  really nice, stable, lightweight and powerful. With bunch of plugins, including FTP, Json viewer, Hex editor,... along with perfect syntax highlight and code folding for over 50 programming, scripting, and markup languages, I was a faithful of N++ before I came into Sublime Text.

Rich, Fast, Usefull and really Powerful are euphemistically word to Sublime Text.
