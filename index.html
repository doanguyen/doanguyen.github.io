<h3> Hi, I'm Nguyen Van Dung </h3>
<p> I graduated from Hanoi University of Science with the Degree of BSc in the field of Material Science. Until January 2015, I've been a Master student in Department of Physics, Hanyang University. Which means i do research, like a rookie with a limit of publications. I also like to write code, all kinds, but mostly Matlab and Python. </p>

<p> After 1 year living in Korea, working with brilliant people, it changed my life a lot. </p>

It's not much, but I wrote some personal stories to kill free time. It has been archived.
