<h3> Hi, I'm Nguyen Van Dung </h3>
I graduated from Hanoi University of Science with the Degree of BSc in the field of Material Science. 2 years after, I got the Master degree's in Department of Physics, Hanyang University. Now, I'm a PhD student at the Institute of Neel, doing something about Graphene and 2D materials, like a rookie with a limit of <a href="/publications.html">publications</a>. I also like to write code, all kinds, but mostly Php and Python.
<br />
It's not much, but I wrote some personal stories to kill free time. It's been <a href="/archives">archived</a>.
